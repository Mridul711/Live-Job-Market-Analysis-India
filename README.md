# 📊 Automated Job Market Aggregator (India Edition)

## 🚀 Project Overview
As a fresher entering the Data Analytics market, I realized that manually searching for jobs is inefficient. I wanted a data-driven approach to understand **where** the jobs are and **exactly what skills** are in demand right now.

I built a Python-based **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Pipeline** that:
1.  **Scrapes** real-time job listings from LinkedIn (via Guest API) and Internshala.
2.  **Cleans** messy location data (e.g., merging "Gurugram", "Noida", "New Delhi" into "Delhi/NCR").
3.  **Extracts** hard technical skills (SQL, Python, Power BI) using a dictionary-based matching algorithm, filtering out corporate buzzwords.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
* **Web Scraping:** `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`
* **Data Cleaning:** `Pandas`, `RegEx (re)`
* **Visualization:** `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`

## 📂 Key Files
* `linkedin_india_bulk.py`: The scraper script. Fetches 100-500 jobs using pagination and anti-bot delays.
* `analyze_india_market.py`: The analysis engine. Contains the **Strict Skill Dictionary** and **Location Mapping** logic.
* `linkedin_india_bulk.csv`: The raw dataset generated by the scraper.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visuals
The script generates a dashboard (`final_job_market_analysis_v4.png`) revealing the current market state:

### 1. Top Locations
My analysis standardized various city names (e.g., "Bangalore Urban", "Bengaluru") to identify that **Bengaluru** and **Delhi/NCR** currently hold >60% of Data Analyst openings.

### 2. Most In-Demand Skills
Instead of relying on generic job titles, I used a **Keyword Allowlist** to scan job roles. The data confirms that **SQL**, **Python**, and **Excel** are the top 3 non-negotiable skills for entry-level roles, followed closely by **Power BI**.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mridul711/Live-Job-Market-Analysis-India.git
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 matplotlib seaborn
    ```
3.  **Run the Scraper:**
    ```bash
    python linkedin_india_bulk.py
    ```
4.  **Run the Analysis:**
    ```bash
    python analyze_india_market.py
    ```

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions
* **Challenge:** LinkedIn job titles often contain noise (e.g., "Urgent Hiring", "Immediate Joiner").
* **Solution:** Implemented a **Strict Blocklist & Allowlist** system using Python sets to filter out 50+ noise words and isolate technical keywords only.
* **Challenge:** Duplicate locations (e.g., "Gurgaon" vs "Gurugram").
* **Solution:** Built a custom mapping function in Pandas to standardize satellite cities into their major metropolitan hubs.
